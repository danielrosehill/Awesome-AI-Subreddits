# List development prompt

Help me to populate Readme with a structure for an Awesome Github repository.

I'll list the subreddits I would like to add, the sections, and some notes.

Your objective is to integrate them into the markdown and add a TOC. note today's date as the last update (13-02-2025).

For each subreddit listed, add consistent formatting: a markdown badge with the link and a live subscriber count. 

I have added some comments throughout the list, so please integrate them and preserve the hierarchy as I've layed it out.

Note: I've deliberately included some subreddits in multiple categories. Occasionally, rather than describe the sobreds myself, I've copied and pasted their descriptions. Where I've done this, I've used quotation marks. Make this clear by providing the descriptions as quotes So that they're easy to distinguish from my own comments. Sometimes, I'll offer both (my own comments, the sub description)
